Hello everyone, this is a personal project. An API based on Node.js and Mongodb. It is currently under construction, and I will send more code in the next days, weeks and update that message.

That api has the following characteristics:

-> Create users in the database
-> Registration
-> Product search

And also create a prank test for the product search function.


If everyone wants to collaborate or sugest anything, the door is open. :D
