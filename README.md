<H2>Greetings!</H2>
Hello everyone, this is a personal project. An API based on Node.js and Mongodb. It is currently under construction, and I will send more code in the next days, weeks and update that message.

<b>That api has the following characteristics:</b>

-> Create users in the database<br>
-> Registration<br>
-> Product search<br>

And also create a Jest test for the product search function.

<b>Actualizacions</b>

->Finished the get products functions<br>
->Built a simple test for the query class and for the /p routes

<b>Recommendations and Acknowledgments</b>

If everyone wants to collaborate or sugest anything, the door is open. :D
